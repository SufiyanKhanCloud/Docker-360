# Lesson 1 – Logs Basics (ELK Foundation)

## 1. What is a Log?
A log is a written record of what a system or application is doing.

Whenever:
- An application starts
- A user logs in
- An error occurs
- A request is processed  

The system writes a message.  
That message is called a **log**.

> Log = system diary

## 2. Why Logs Are Important
Logs are used to:
- Find errors
- Debug issues
- Understand system behavior
- Monitor performance
- Track security events
- Perform auditing

Without logs, troubleshooting becomes guesswork.

---

## 3. Real-Life Example
If a website becomes slow:

- Without logs → reason is unknown  
- With logs → slow requests, database issues, or high resource usage can be identified

Logs help answer **why** something failed.

---

## 4. Types of Logs

### Application Logs
Generated by applications.
Examples:
- Application started
- Database connection failed

---

### System Logs
Generated by the operating system.
Examples:
- User login
- Service start or stop

---

### Access Logs
Record incoming requests.
Examples:
- `GET /login 200`
- `POST /api 500`

---

### Security Logs
Track security-related events.
Examples:
- Failed login attempts
- Unauthorized access

---

## 5. Log Levels
Log levels show the importance of log messages.

| Level | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| INFO | Normal information |
| DEBUG | Developer details |
| WARN | Warning |
| ERROR | Something went wrong |
| FATAL | System crash |

Example:
```

ERROR - Database connection failed

```

## 6. Log Structure

### Unstructured Log (Bad)
```

User login failed at night

```

Problems:
- Difficult to search
- Hard to analyze

---

### Structured Log (Good)
```

time=2026-01-29
level=ERROR
user=sufi
action=login

```

Benefits:
- Easy searching
- Easy filtering
- Better dashboards

ELK works best with **structured logs**.

---

## 7. Role of ELK in Logging
ELK processes logs in three steps:

- **Logstash** → Collects and processes logs
- **Elasticsearch** → Stores and searches logs
- **Kibana** → Visualizes and analyzes logs

Log Flow:
```

Logs → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana

```

---

## 8. Why ELK Is Used (Interview Answer)
ELK is used to:
- Collect logs centrally
- Parse and structure logs
- Store logs efficiently
- Search and analyze data
- Visualize logs using dashboards

---

## 9. Common Beginner Mistakes
- Ignoring logs
- Sending raw logs directly to Elasticsearch
- Not using log levels
- Not structuring logs properly

---

## 10. Quick Summary
- Logs record system activity
- Logs help debug and monitor systems
- Structured logs are preferred
- ELK manages logs end-to-end
- Logstash processes logs
- Elasticsearch stores logs
- Kibana visualizes logs
```
