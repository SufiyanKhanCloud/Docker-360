ELK STACK – PHASE 1 & PHASE 2
Beginner Concept Notes
===============================

--------------------------------
PHASE 1: BIG PICTURE OF ELK
--------------------------------

ELK Stack = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana

ELK is used for:
- Centralized logging
- Searching logs
- Monitoring systems
- Debugging issues
- Visualizing data

--------------------------------
ELK COMPONENTS (CORE IDEA)
--------------------------------

1) Logstash
-----------
What it is:
- A log processing tool

Why it is used:
- Collects logs from different sources
- Parses and cleans logs
- Converts messy logs into structured data

What it does:
- Input → Filter → Output

Example:
- Reads system logs
- Extracts fields (time, level, message)
- Sends clean logs to Elasticsearch

2) Elasticsearch
----------------
What it is:
- A search and analytics engine

Why it is used:
- Stores logs
- Indexes logs
- Allows fast searching

Important idea:
- Elasticsearch does NOT store data like a normal database
- It stores data as indexes for fast search

Example:
- Search error logs in last 10 minutes
- Find failed login attempts

3) Kibana
---------
What it is:
- A visualization tool

Why it is used:
- View logs in browser
- Create dashboards
- Analyze trends

Example:
- Graph of errors per hour
- Dashboard showing system health
